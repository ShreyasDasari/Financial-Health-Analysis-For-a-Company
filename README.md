## Overview

This project provides an end-to-end financial analysis pipeline that helps businesses understand their financial health through data-driven insights. Using Python and machine learning techniques, it analyzes multiple financial metrics to reveal patterns, relationships, and future trends.

### Business Value
- **Identify** financial trends and patterns across time
- **Validate** data integrity and accounting consistency  
- **Predict** future financial metrics with high accuracy
- **Visualize** complex financial relationships in intuitive formats
- **Enable** data-driven strategic decision-making

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data Validation**: Ensures accounting principles are followed (e.g., Profit = Revenue - Expenses)
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Examines 12 financial metrics including Revenue, Expenses, Assets, Liabilities, and Cash Flow
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Time series analysis, correlation heatmaps, distribution plots, and scatter plots
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models achieving perfect accuracy for deterministic relationships
- **Annual Aggregation**: Converts granular data into yearly summaries for strategic planning
- **Statistical Analysis**: Distribution testing, outlier detection, and correlation analysis

## üìä Dataset

The analysis uses a financial dataset containing:
- **20,000 records** of company financial data
- **12 key metrics**:
  - Date (temporal dimension)
  - Revenue, Expenses, Profit (income statement items)
  - Cash Flow (liquidity metric)
  - Assets, Liabilities, Debt (balance sheet items)
  - Marketing Spend, Operational Cost (expense categories)
  - Employee Count (organizational metric)
  - Tax Paid (compliance metric)

**Data Source**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ShreyasDasari/Financial-Health-Analysis-For-a-Company/blob/main/Data/financial_health_analysis_dataset.csv)

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Financial-Health-Analysis-For-a-Company.git
cd Financial-Health-Analysis-For-a-Company
```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install required packages**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
```

Or install all requirements at once:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. **Open the analysis notebook**
   - Navigate to `Financial_Health_Analysis.ipynb`
   - Run cells sequentially for complete analysis

3. **Key Sections to Explore**:
   - Data Loading and Exploration
   - Data Quality Validation
   - Statistical Distribution Analysis
   - Time Series Visualization
   - Correlation Analysis
   - Predictive Modeling
   - Annual Performance Summary

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. **Data Acquisition & Exploration**
- Load data directly from GitHub repository
- Initial data inspection and structure analysis
- Data type validation and missing value check

### 2. **Data Quality Assurance**
- Verify accounting equation integrity
- Identify and handle inconsistencies
- Validate mathematical relationships

### 3. **Statistical Analysis**
- Distribution analysis using probability plots
- Outlier detection with boxplots
- Correlation matrix computation

### 4. **Visualization Suite**
- Time series plots for trend analysis
- Correlation heatmaps for relationship discovery
- Scatter plots for bivariate analysis
- Actual vs Predicted comparisons

### 5. **Predictive Modeling**
- Feature engineering and scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Perfect prediction analysis (R¬≤ = 1.0)

### 6. **Strategic Insights**
- Annual aggregation for year-over-year analysis
- Future profit projections
- Actionable recommendations

## Key Findings

### 1. **Perfect Data Integrity**
- All records maintain proper accounting relationships
- No inconsistencies in profit calculations
- High data quality enables reliable analysis

### 2. **Deterministic Relationships**
- Perfect model predictions (R¬≤ = 1.0) indicate mathematical relationships
- Profit follows exact formula: Revenue - Expenses
- Validates accounting principles in the dataset

### 3. **Financial Patterns**
- Strong positive correlations between revenue and profit
- Operational costs scale proportionally with total expenses
- Clear seasonal and temporal trends visible

### 4. **Predictive Insights**
- Future profits can be calculated with certainty given revenue and expense projections
- Focus should shift to predicting independent variables (revenue drivers)

## Visualizations

The notebook generates several key visualizations:

1. **Time Series Analysis**: Revenue, Profit, and Expenses trends over time
2. **Correlation Heatmap**: Relationships between all financial metrics
3. **Distribution Plots**: Probability plots for each metric
4. **Boxplot Analysis**: Outlier detection across all features
5. **Scatter Plots**: Operational Cost vs Total Expenses relationship
6. **Prediction Accuracy**: Actual vs Predicted profit comparison
7. **Future Projections**: Historical and predicted profit trends

## Technical Implementation

### Libraries Used
```python
import pandas as pd           # Data manipulation
import numpy as np           # Numerical operations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Visualization
import seaborn as sns        # Statistical plots
from scipy.stats import probplot  # Distribution analysis
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler  # Feature scaling
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score  # Model evaluation
```

### Model Performance
- **Mean Squared Error**: ~10^-22 (essentially zero)
- **R-squared Score**: 1.0 (perfect prediction)
- Indicates deterministic relationships rather than statistical patterns

## Future Enhancements
